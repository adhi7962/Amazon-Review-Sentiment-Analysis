It is known issue with the buds, and you need to reset the device to get it back, and then again the crackling starts in 3-10 hours.Orignal review was for 3 stars as below:Pros:+ Premium packaging+ Quick pairing with OP phone+ Stylish+ (Hopefully) good battery+ USB C interface - no need for me to carry another charging cable+ Enviromental noise cancellation+ Quality of micCons:- Very very poor sound quality. A 399/- pair of wired earphones have better sound quality.- The red cable provided is a sham. It is not warp or dash charging enabled. Also, it is too short! The cost cutting in this department at 2k is not justified- Clumsy, the rubber and buttons are plain clumsy. They never sit properly, even curl some neck clumsily. On dropping the bus down, they hardly ever get magnetically closed.- No carrying pouch. The money that's wasted in the packaging which I'll never use again might have better utilised in provinding a proper pouch for the clumsy earphone- HD quality codecs like APTx etc are simply not available for this piece...All in all this product is a sham, stay away. May be at 999/- it would be a good buy!Update after 9-10 months of use:The right bud was less loud than left, but I ignored because it was minor difference. 9 months later, now right bud sounds is very less than the left one.

4,Prajwal G,After viewing too many reviews on youtube I think that op bullets wireless Z will have very little bass that's why I ordered the bass edition but after trying the bass edition I found very heavy bass in this version. but as I Iove flat sound signature I feel the bass is over boosted and I am getting headaches after using it for a long time. So I decided to replace the bass edition with a regular one. People who love heavy bass can definitely go with bass edition. I love rich vocals and instruments with proper balance bass so this bass version definitely not for me. Hope the people who are confused between regular vs bass edition will get an idea from my review.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Not for me (too much bass)
5,Uddipan,"quick feature doesn't work and even pairing with a new device distorts connectivity in a strange manner. May be i use iphone that’s why there’s a problem in Bluetooth codec. you need to reset the device everytime to solve this issue. very pathetic engineering from oneplus. work around is - never use quick pair feature. after using it with one device you just turn off the headphn, turn off bluetooth on that device, and then connect another deviceUpdate: i have exchanged my headphones and this one has the same issue.

22,Gopal Singh Rana,"Just received my product from OnePlus brand..........first of all the build quality is super duper solid, i mean literally OnePlus did a great job on this product. The sound quality is also very superb though i have purchased bass edition but i can fell that the bass quality lies between 4-5 on the scale of 5. The connection between different devices is also again very superb, it gets connected in milliseconds. The comfortability is very good, i feel no pain during heavy music sessions. It supports fast charging so you can charge it with your fast charger. It am using my laptop to charge this device but you can buy any fast charger you like but remember, only buy branded ones not cheap like quality chargers which are available at cheaper rate. I would recommend samsung 15 or 30 watt fast charger or you can also go for OnePlus official charger.Verdict: The overall quality of this product is very good at this price range, i would definately give you green light to go and buy this product (especially bass edition). It is great product under 2k.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Best Wireless Neckband Earphones from OnePlus Brand
23,Devansh,"Here is my review after 30 days usage of OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z BASS EDITION. Spend some minutes to know every truth of these neckband earphones.1. DESIGN and BUILD QUALITY: Completely made of premium looking plastic. Earbuds are made with glossy shiny plastic and due to usage of plastic you are very far away from the danger of getting accidental shock in case of defective electronics. Neckband is very smooth and overall the complete earphones are very light in weight. Earbuds fit in the ear perfectly. You can have a closer look at every part of these neckband earphones in the pics I have uploaded.2. BATTERY BACKUP: I was slightly disappointed here. The mentioned music playtime on the box was 17 hours at normal volume usage. I noted the time when I used them and found real life music play time. I got a total of 14 hours and 41 minutes of music play time at LOW VOLUME which is very less when you are using them at very low volume.But you can listen to music for about 12 hours at 70 - 80% volume. The battery went down from 100 to 50% in 7 hours 25 minutes. The battery gets fully charged in less than 50 minutes with my 18 watt fast charger. The best thing is the battery gets about 70%  charged in just 10 minutes ! If you use earphones about two hours daily then you need to charge them only on Sundays.3. SOUND QUALITY: No words for the sound quality! Just amazing! Its name BASS EDITION fully justifies. Highs,mids and lows of the music are very clear. Vocals are also crisp and clear. Bass is too good and balanced one. No connectivity issues while I walked in my whole house listening to music and the phone was in one corner of a room !  👉👉OnePlus have done cost cutting also. The wire length should be 3 to 4 cm more.  IS IT VALUE FOR MONEY? 💰💰 : Of course, I can say yes, it is value for money headphones. You will like them definitely.  ✅👉👉Agar Bhai ya Behen aap Indian ho toh bahut jyada bass ke chakkar mei or 400-500 rupees bachane ke chakkar mei Boat rockers taraf mat jana. Aapka sar dard karne lag jayega unko sunkar because the bass is too high and unbalanced and the human voice ( voice of singer) is very much suppressed due to bass. And Boult walo ne bass ke naam par majak kiya hua hai. I am saying this coz I have used almost 10 to 15 latest neckband earphones of my friends and my own. Realme Buds Wireless Pro are also very nice neckband headphones but remember they cost 4000 rupees.  🔥🔥But inke jaisi sound quality or high+balanced bass apko kahi nahi milega wo bhi 2000 rupees dekar !!  I hesitated for 1 month to buy these earphones but I am very glad after buying these earphones at last. So I suggest you  not to hesitate and go for it if your budget is 2000 rupees. Don't look for any other neckband earphones in this price range. If you will try to save some rupees then you are prone to fall for a low quality sound experience.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Review after 1 month of continuous use👇
24,Rajiv P Rai,"Bought this for Mom who is into wired earphones but gets irritated by the tangling wires.The sound is not at the level of Bose, Airpods or Sony, but if you have to choose between boat, leaf, tagg and other VFM brands, then these wireless earphones are overkill for the price.Used these for Zoom Calls on my laptop as well and there were hardly any drops.Microphone worked flawlessly and sound was also clear.Bass is 4/5 but ears start paining after 2 hours of continuous usage, so one has to keep that in mind!Overall Verdict: The best VFM in the sub-3k price range for wireless earphones.Bass: 4/5Comfort: 4/5Treble: 3.5/5Battery: 5/5Connectivity: 4.5/5",4.0 out of 5 stars,4,The Perfect VFM buy in entry level wireless headphones
25,Roshan hp,After seeing all the good reviews i purchased this.Built quality: 4.5/5 for first look this can be changed after long use.Sound quality: no woww factor in listening any high bass movies or instrumental songs.Battery : it takes 1 hour 20 mins to charge full to give u 17hrs of usage time. Red light turn to white to indicate full charge. 10 min charge to 10hours is just a gimik.Mic: better than previous version nothing like crystal clear.Confirt: holds good and light.,3.0 out of 5 stars,3,"Average bullet , no woww factor after using for a day"
26,Amazing Customer,"Cons:Few features that are not openly mentioned. Normal Z version has a quick switch button but the Z Bass does not have this button. Auto pause is enabled when the ear pieces are joined together magnetically (off) however auto play is not enabled when they are separated (on). Right and left earpiece is not mentioned. So you have to try on your own for best fit. Though few forums suggest the right side has volume controls. These cons make you doubt the marketing intention of OnePlus.Pros:Good build, fast charging, light weight, wires are good, soft and flexible on skin, overall good sound quality, looks good, etc. Gives a feeling that you got good product giving device/product.Overall - go for it (but choose wisely between Z and Z Bass edition)",4.0 out of 5 stars,4,This is different from normal Z and Z Bass

28,Sachin S.,"Oneplus has become a big brand, and the earphones that I received feels great in hand, and the sound quality was good too. Biggest issue is connecting and disconnecting with my Oneplus phone. First time pairing took a lot of time, then everytime it should auto connect it was not connecting automatically. I had to manually connect in BT option. After 2 days of purchase it stopped pairing itself.

29,Tarun Soni,"Review from an audio enthusiast, Used Sennheisers, AKG's, Audio Technica's for long time._______________________Purchased the bass Edition.Really great pair of earphones you can buy under 2K right now. (Bass Edition only)They really have improved the sound from their last generation earphones.Bass has really improved quality wise it's improved, loudness remains the same (Great response from 25HZ - 35HZ)Mids and treble has also improved, less muddy mids now, more crisp and sharp (in a good way) trebles now.You can hear other instruments too.. so its balanced not just boommyyy or anything with the bass.Use Equalizer and turn up the low frequencies up, you will be amazed by the bass response.Go ahead buy the bass edition only, you wont get any good under 2K.Cheers!!",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,"Awesome, Better then normal Ones"
30,Saumya,"The product was delivered the same day I purchased (Yaay! Amazon prime). But the earphone failed to impress me due to low vol in its right ear. I usually listen music at 60-80% volumes. So as soon I listened through these earphone I could tell there is some mismatch between volumes in the ears. So I listened again at low volume (30%) but could not hear anything from Right but the Left worked fine. I have opted for a replacement due to the right ear issue, although I wanted to return it but no option for it. Will update whether the problem still exists in the replaced earphone I get or not.Update: Received the replaced earphones, they still have the issue. I'm keeping it because of no return policy. However, the sound quality is good but bass is low, but okay.",2.0 out of 5 stars,2,Don't forget to check if both the ears produce same sound quality
31,Vineet D.,"The device stopped working with in 40 days of buying. (Well this is normal , could happen to any chinese electronic device )Problem is the customer care passed on in complete information. They did not convey the message that each service center is accepting 40 request only every day. And there is no home pick up of faulty devices.I saw about 100 people standing a queue in TDI mall Rajouri and they had to go back home because they could not get the tocken.I would say poor experience in dealing with service and customer care.",1.0 out of 5 stars,1,Customer service
32,Adi,"I bought these as i was previously a Bullet Wireless use and had two sets bought over period of time. I fell so much in love with the produc that we shipped to all our Team members as gift during lockdown. Going by the same impression i bought Bass edition as it had all the same features listed on its official website. It's only after receiving the product i realized that OnePlus went the Chinese way and did false advertising. It does not have Quick switch feature and u can simply disconnect from current device and then connect to second device. The experience does not change even if you are using OnePlus phone as they claim. Disheartened by the deceptive advertising. Horrible experience and now it's time to say GOODBYE TO OnePlus as a Brand. No wonder all YouTubers who used to go gaga over OnePlus have been bashing recently.

36,Rahil,"Overall it's good but the shiny protion has too many scratchs.Talking about the sound quality it's good. For a heavy bass user it seems to be balanced bass but for me it has bass more than enough, if more bass boosted then the background instrumental music will be depressed. It's vocals sounds clear and Avg crisp, but the feeling from inside remain inside only at medium volume. From my experience I noticed that increasing the volume increases the bass and crispness.Overall it's best budget neckband in 2000. I have tested realme wirless in which driver mm are only and only number the bass the treble are less than avg. 1+ offers a very very good battery life.

The build quality is top too. Materials used are fairly high quality.I guess I got a defective product. Will have to go to the store to see if they would replace. If they do, I'll let you know.If they don't replace, i don't think I would recommend it.

39,Sridhar,I did a lot of research before deciding to buy this. I was initially keen on buying a TWS but none of them were giving great quality of sound vs cost paid ratio. And I also learnt that within a year most budget tws stop working one stem. So I decided to go with this.Now I consider myself a basshead. I like punchy bass. Kinda like boat earphones when they launched. After that they became too bass heavy. This is not that. This has the right amount of bass. It's not exactly punchy but it's almost as good as it. And this sounds signature is almost impossible to find. I have listened to a lot of wired and tws earphones and nothing comes close to this. Only sony basshead surpass this but it's 4 times the price.The vocals and mids are well represented and you get an overall great music experience.I have a one plus phone so I have had no issues in gaming with these. There was a very slight delay in the normal mode but in fnatic mode the syncis perfect. I did notice a couple of sound outages when the game starts but 1700 me taj mahal khareednahai kya?Overall it's a really great but for this price range. Go for it.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Near perfection for under 2k
40,LOTUS,"Sound is awesome , specifically the bass .I was a fan of realme ,used that almost 7 months . But after using this ,I must say this is better than realme in sound . Needless to say I am a bass lover. I am using oneplus 6T so maybe that is also a factor.CONS : -1. Noise cancellation should be little bit better.2. If you are listening music and suddenly you watch a video in YouTube then after end of the YouTube video you have to manually play the song. In realme it automatically play the song .Pro :-1. Bass2. Latency is way better (Almost zero) than other  earphones under Rs 2000. ( I almost tried all)3. Battery capacity : Nonstop music ,video  ....around 18 hours .4.

If the bass version is so light on bass, I wonder how the earlier models used to perform. But other wise this is good piece.Moreover the bluetooth toggle button is not present in this model (my oversight while buying) which is not a good step. As ability to toggle between devices with press of a button is really very good feature.

42,Sachin Kharat,"Had a great expectations from this 1+ so called bass edition earphones. But got very disappointed with the quality of sound it produces.Great connectivityGreat mic qualityGreat ear comfortGreat built qualityVery poorest sound quality, which is main purpose of any earphones.Had checked reviews of this on various platforms like YT & other ecom websites, there were so many positive reviews. Now I am strongly feeling it those all were seems paid reviews.If I wanted this kind of worst bass, then I could have went for Ptron. I am not de-grading Ptron, because they are offering products at less pricing & can't expect much from them.But if 1+ is taking 2k for their so called bass edition earphones, but they are not providing that much good quality bass. By just adding dhoom dhoom bass they have simply hampered the sound quality.Many time I love to hear songs at close to full volume & listening those in 1+ are so irritating. I have to try & keep changing equaliser settings for every single song in my F62 phone.My Sennheiser CX180 at far far far giving great sound quality.So my honest opinion strongly not recommended for those who actually looking good quality sound output.Those who just looking for just dhoom dhoom sound, please don't waist your 2k for 1+. Go for Ptron instead, at least you'll save your min 1k rupees.",1.0 out of 5 stars,1,Honest Review- Simply Disappointed with 1+

45,Vishnu Rajeev,"This review might be long, but it's honest. These are one of the best in ear wireless earphones for the price, out in the market right now. I purchased this for my brother, and later, I got the same earphones for my birthday. I also use a Sony WI-C400 (priced around Rs.3500) and Apple Airpods Pro, and I will be comparing the bullets wireless Z bass edition with these two.Pros:1) This one charges very quickly, especially if you have a OnePlus Warp charger adapter. I use a OnePlus 8 and these earphones charges to a 100% in around 40 mins. The Sony on the other hand takes around 3 hours to get to full charge.2) It pairs instantly. As soon as you separate both the earpieces, it pairs with the phone in under 4 seconds. It is similar to what happens with an iPhone and Airpods/Airpods Pro. To pause the music or video, you just have to clip them both together, which also turns off the earphones, thus saving battery.3) Very lightweight and comfortable. The earphones weigh just 28 grams, and while wearing them, I don't actually feel it. It also looks good when one wears it. The Sony earphones were heavy and sometimes uncomfortable.4) The sound quality is very good. It is actually better than the Sony in terms of clarity and loudness. I rarely have to raise the volume to 50%. The bass is decent; I wouldn't say it's great, even with the bass edition. But considering the price, the bass is pretty good.5) IP55 water resistance means that I can use these earphones while working out or when I go out cycling.Cons:-1) It has a noticeable amount of latency. Even though OnePlus advertises low latency of 100ms, you can actually feel the latency while watching videos or listening to music. The Sony WI-C400 is way better in terms of latency; it's almost non existent.2) While playing games and listening to music at the same time, the music seems to break every now and then. This did not happen with the Sony WI-C400, and this irritates me every time.Final verdict: If your budget is around 2000-2500, then don't look for anything more, buy the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition. If you are willing to spend more, then I would suggest you go for Sony. I have been a long time Sony user, and all Sony earphones I have used has lasted at least 3 years for me. Sony earphones are made in Vietnam, while OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z Bass Edition is made in China. For me, only time will tell how durable this earphone is, but I'll surely be updating this review is anything goes wrong.",4.0 out of 5 stars,4,"Definitely worth the money, but not the best"

48,Amir M.,"All I was looking for was a decent earpiece. I read its review & researched a bit. I thought it was a good enough earphone will be, for me. I was mistaken. I will also agree that I fell for advertisement, and didn't listen to my heart which was forbidding me to give it a green signal. Sound quality is not even close to what I expected. It's simply flat. It doesn't even have a bass. Very irritating. Why would you go for an earphone, which lacks quality sound? There's no cancellation of noise. I get to hear what people whisper, when I use this earphone, forget it cancelling noise. Only thing you don't have to worry about is its charging. Once charged it runs for a very long time.

54,Chinmaya,"Let me first clearly put this the delivery from Amazon is on time no complaint on the same.The issue is with the product, never anticipated such a poor product from OP.I purchased the product on 8th July, received the product on 10th July.It's unfortunate that I couldn't spare the time to test it completely in first few days to understand the product is not worth. I could realize it after using for 5/6 days, after which I couldn't go for a return or refund.There was too much of rattling noise, even other parties complained about noise.As suggested by Amazon CS, I went to nearest OnePlus service center on a Saturday, they said that I have to come on Monday - Friday between 11 am - 3pm and I have to make a prior appointment on call. I tried to reach over call for an week never got anyone on call.I went to service center directly then they told I have to take an advance token, which I got for 16th Aug. Finally on 16th August I could submit the product. I was told that I'll be updated over call. After 2 weeks also there was no call, so I had to call the help line as the service center phone was never available, and I came to know that for accessories they never call back and my replacement is ready. So went again got my replacement.This time it worked for a while and showed up issues again, so I called up helpline and went for a pickup service.The pickup was prompt no issues, after 10 days I got the parcel too. After opening I realized nothing was done simply they returned the same piece without any information.When I called again they said I can submit again.Lost 2 months of time without using the product. 2 months warranty also gone.

I went to the official service center of oneplus near me, there were around 20 customers and 80% of them had this bullets wireless z and had came to get repaired. Some had their one side of the earphones stopped working, some had an issue with the microphone, some had Bluetooth issues and some were like me, having issues with the sound quality. This product is a total failure. Although some of the customers were getting a replacement which were in warranty and had unsolvable issues, but it's always better to not buy a product which will cost your time and may be money also eventually.

66,BENJAMIN GEORGE THOTTUMKAL,"These earphones are ideal for listening to songs and watching movies but if you're intending to use it for calling activities, please reconsider. The excess bass comes in the way of listening while on call due to which one can't hear clearly what's being said. I've never faced any negative feedback from call recipients with reference to mic quality. There's no echo issue while calling i.e. one does not hear ones own voice while on call. Further, the battery life is awesome. I get 2 days of usage time and a little more for the next day. I typically use this for work which requires me to be on call stand-by for 10 hours per day. Its connectivity is also good. I can continue a conversation outside of a room but it begins to drop if I move into a 2nd room. On initial switch on, it connects to the device instantly. It's extremely comfortable to wear all day long and is light weight. The magnetic touch function is counter productive as it doesn't instantly recieve calls when detached. Thus, one needs to always ensure that both the ear plugs stay detached at all times so that whenever one recieves a call, one can answer it immediately without having to detach it first and then wait for Bluetooth to connect and then attend the call. This is a major inconvenience as such. The buttons are just ok. I wish they would've been more tactile and responsive. Sometimes one really needs to be patient with the volume up and down buttons as they aren't as responsive for operation as one would like it to be. The call recieve and cancel button is good. The ear plugs fit perfectly and can be used for long hours but I personally prefer using any one at a time due to long hours of usage. I haven't felt any radiation side effects like some of my earlier Bluetooth headphones for which I'm thankful. Further, the charging time taken is excellent. Please note there's no active noise cancellation as mentioned by other reviewers.",3.0 out of 5 stars,3,"Ideal for listening to songs, not taking calls"

It should’ve been in the wire but it’s in the band and tends to block under the collar or may be the neck itself.• There is a cracking sound when you regulate the volume.

69,Srijith,"Update: This is a much-delayed update. I took the device over to the service center that very weekend, the good people at the service center did something and got it working again. Haven't had any problems since, hence the updated 3/5 rating from the earlier 1/5.Original Review: I bought this device on 6th Jan 2021, it died on 12th Feb 2021. It died during a morning video call abruptly, the last sound from it was apparently a screech that only my friend could hear and I couldn't. I didn't know at that time that it had died, thought a recharge was all it needed. Alas, that was the very end of it.The two months it lasted, it did well. Many a podcast. audiobooks and songs from all genres were heard with it. And hence the 3 star rating for its features. The last few days of listening to Daft Punk and Gorillaz will be the memories I'll keep.This sad, abrupt and early demise of it has shaken my confidence enough to not consider getting the same OnePlus Bullets or any of their headphones.I will be reaching their service center to see if anything can be done, maybe a replacement that'd last for longer, hoping the service doesn't fall short just as the product did.",3.0 out of 5 stars,3,Edit: The Service Center Revived It!

But the really good part about it is the instant connection from the moment you separate the magnets it will instantly connect to your last connected or closest device which to me is very convenient.

If fit snuggly, they provide ample passive noise cancellation.Strongly recommended for high value for money and performance.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Good performance and value for money.
80,PranS,It has good bass but the problem is that it's not deep and is somewhat on the sharper side. And that spoils the overall sound quality.

84,Ashish Lyke Gurung,"Been wanting to buy this for sometime,but as usual,had to do my research first,and boy was it worth it!  I'll keep the review simple-Pros.*Build quality is nice,not luxury-premium nice,but feels robust and doesn't feel cheap.*Very comfortable to wear,the earbuds fit snugly in the ears.. the neckband part is made of a soft and smooth silicon material that feels velvety.** Connectivity is pretty perfect😁.using the magnetic on off system is very smooth and seamless.I tried testing the distance it could maintain by keeping my phone on my bed,while playing some music and I pretty much walked all around the house,even went upstairs.no trouble,at some angles,even four thick walls didn't make a difference 🤔*** Sound quality- I'd say like a 8/10. But given the price you're getting this at,it's a 10/10.It sounds crystal clear,decent soundstage.Zero cable noise,and yes,it's definitely been tuned for extra bass!! It did feel a bit bass heavy in some styles of music,but never overbearing. A little tweaking with the EQ and you'll obviously find your preference. Having said that, it sounds well balanced straight out of the box.** This unit does not have ANC,but because of it's in-ear form factor,the noise cancellation is  good enough... You can't hear anything while you have music on for sure. (It does get annoying is you're chewing crisps or something 😂)*Battery life is excellent,lasts atleast 2-3 days of regular use.Like, I won't use it for the said 17hrs straight, obviously.*does not induce battery anxiety.Been using it for like 4days,charged it only once so far.Now haven't come across any Cons so far, my only concern is its a bit uncomfortable to lie down in bed with(on your sides),as the shape of the buds either get the sound blocked or it pushes on parts of your ear uncomfortably.Now let's see how it holds up with long term use.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Really happy with this.

85,Shubham,Disappointed with this piece by one plus.They claim 17 hours after the bass boost whtever they have done.I had the normal bullets one of one plus too before. This one just doesn't last that long. It will drain in 12 hours with a full charge of constant use. The price is the same as the previous one. But I think they have saved some money on this one.Quality of cable is good. Build quality is good. But go for the normal bullets one. Is what I will suggest. Those are way way better and they last 18-19 hours too of usage. ( Claims 20) still fine.,1.0 out of 5 stars,1,Battery didn't last as claimed 17 hours.

Yes the sound is louder in realme headphones but the quality of sound is better in one plus.BASS QUALITY - No doubt why it's named bass edition it's really powerful, thumpy and don't get distort even at full volume.COMFORT : I find it less comfortable than oppo enco. If you can gave up on sound quality over comfort, go for oppo enco. Those are really comfortable not gonna lie.BATTERY : Warp charging works really amazing and on full charge i think 3-4 days for me I listen almost 3-4 hours of music and calling for 1-2 hours daily.CONNECTIVITY : REALLY FAST LITERALLY.

It's way better than Competitors and other brands like Jabra etc., and the Bluetooth Range is incredible.The sound is loud enough, but I would request the OnePlus Team to use them at least 10/12 mm Driver in the edition.

95,Dinesh Chayanam,"I had purchased this for the second time after my first one was stolen. The first was ones wire was peeling after one month of use. The second one worked well for 7 months after which battery backup fell drastically and I was recharging it almost twice a day. 9 months into it, the magnetic on-off is not working . I was initially happy at the price and quality it was offered but if this is its level of endurance then it is as normal as any non branded or competitors neckband and makes no sense to pay higher price . I bought this as a gift for two of my friends one of which had latency issues within the first week. Sure to say will not buy this again for myself or anyone else. If you are ready to take a chance, the sound, bass quality and noise attenuation are nice and adequate for most audiophiles. The lows are not as crisp . It gets pretty loud.

96,Bhavishya Negi,These are good but can be better much betterIf you are in love with music 🎶 though these are also in the category of bad these are decent but if you more of a music lover go for oppo m31 wireless earphones.What I feel is this is a good purchase these will serve you very well for work out sessions and runs.The best thing is connectivity just detach the magnets and it is paired with your phone it can be a one plus device or anyone the connectivity is top notch.You can pair 3 devices at a time though it does not have a connectivity switch button like the original one but still it does the work.I am quite happy and relaxed with this purchase the battery backup is awesome listening from 3 days with like 4hrs of use everyday still it is not out of charge.,3.0 out of 5 stars,3,"Good one from 1+ at this price point, must buy if you are not a music lover"
97,Sajel Saxena,"The product was delivered nicely and on time, so no issues there. The design is also pretty cool, the color and build quality are decent.However, I mainly purchased these as an upgrade after my OnePlus bullets wireless Z (non-base edition).  They didn't turn out to be an upgrade. The bass is improved, sure, but at the cost of clarity in voice quality. If you want loud sound, these are decent. However, the clarity and ""originality"" of sound is not as good as it's former version.Besides that, my use case for headphones is on my OnePlus 7T Pro and my MacBook Pro (2019). They work fine on OP 7T Pro, but that's a constant cracking sound while connected to Macbook and it was super annoying. I've seen some tutorials for how to get rid of it, tried them but didn't seem to be working. But then I didn't spend enough time on the problem so I believe it could be solved if I tried harder.One more reason that I hate this particular version over it's precursor is the absence of a quick switch.  Currently, I do not need to touch my devices (phone or MacBook) to connect my headphones to them. All I need to do is double-tap the switch on headphones and it disconnects with one, connects to the other. Double-tap again and it switches to the former one. However, in this particular version, that button has gone and now, you have to go into Bluetooth settings of the device that you want to connect these headphones with, even after they are paired. It sucks.",3.0 out of 5 stars,3,Fine product but not even close to former OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z

101,Martin,"Note : GOT the solution for cracking sound.  The crackling sound comes when you use the headphones at full volume. And if your device have a option like absolute volume that is used to maintain bluetooth headphone and phone device volume consistent. In this mode makes the bluetooth headset in full volume so don't use that.Last few years i only used wired headphones only and that is also only from boat products. When coming in to bluetooth headphone i checked out different product. . Most of the reviewers had this one in the 1st place. It will be best for the OnePlus and iphone devices.Pros1. Once both magnet connected it will automatically disconnect. And if you remove them it conncets instantly. Even though during calls you may feel a 1 or 2 sec delay.2. Battery was awesome. It depends on the usage for me it will last 2 to 3 days.3. Audio quality and bass is ok for the price. Volume is also good.4. Build quality is good not the best.Cons1. After a few days i have faced cracking sound. I have reset the headset but it won't go . Then i tried change the codec it worked for a day. Then it happens again so you have to do the samething again like a loop. I don't know how long i have to the samething.2. No aptx, LDAC only SBC for android and AAC for iphone users. That's worst.3. There is quick switch button or last redial features.4. Gaming only useful if you have oneplus deviceIt's not worth for 2000 rs😡",3.0 out of 5 stars,3,It's an ok product

I even tried replacing this headset with a new one to check if the one i received was faulty.

But it is not a problem we can turn off the Bluetooth and fix the issue within a minute. Like simple every item has some disadvantages in their own.

Wired hands free are good but pick up too much of ambient noise which is a pain for the other person.  Randomly picked this up but was surprised at the noise cancellation... Cuts out most of the regular noises like a bike passing by or a loud fan and the regular kitchen noises.  Pairs seemlessly with BT devices and love the way the call switches back to the original device when you keep both the ear pieces together (ends are magnetic).

I used a regular non-bluetooth headphone and didn't have this issue. So I still have to use my old headphone, which sucks.

Even if you don't, doesn't make much of a difference.Sound quality is far better than I expected with a balanced sound system. It's not very bass-heavy that muffles all the other frequencies, but enough bass to feel that sweet beat you hear in EDM songs.Tl;dr, you won't feel like you're listening to music muffled by a pillow, that's characteristic of other bass-focused earphones out there.The price is justified.

Oneplus claims quick-switch in their product description, but with a footnote saying you need to select the device from the paired devices list in each device for switching between them-- outright stupid I would say.

131,Jas Parekh,These are a good set of earphones but they come in with a con that I’m totally not okay with.The overall sound stage is good but the crackling sound is REAL! Though the crackling sound is faint and feeble once you notice is it’s difficult to ignore. Creates a lot of problem while watching videos and on calls. I don’t see a fix for this and will have to live with it but it’s poor from OnePlus to not address this issue.PS: I’m using the set with my iPhone not sure if the crackling sound exists on Android devices. I will try to test the headphones with an android device and update my review.,3.0 out of 5 stars,3,Good product but could be better!

OnePlus Magnetic disconnection works perfectly as expected.But the big holdup here is the quick switch feature.  When even models from 2019 with Bluetooth 4.0 were giving 2-way bluetooth connection (connected simultaneously with 2 devices for music and calls) this device doesn't support it (ONLY CONNECT TO 1 DEVICE) which is really a shame. Its like launching a new product and actually degrading it.in the previous wireless Z models there was a Quick Switch button which could help switching connection with multiple paired devices but in this model (Bass edition) that quick switch button is removed -_- and in their product description page it's written Quick Switch now works differently -  USE THE SMARTPHONE BLUETOOTH MENU AND SELECT ONEPLUS WIRELESS TO PERFORM IT.  This line is actually a scam  and coz everytime of We have to devices to Switch it's not Quick-Switch anymore  and MOREOVER  once this Neckband is connected to 1 device other paired devices can't connect to it even selecting it from the device....

The sound is loud and crisp, the bass feels great and the battery life is awesome. Neckbands are better as they are easy to use compared to TWS where there is a chance of losing them if you drop them accidentally. The battery backup is more than anyone would require and it charges really fast.Recommended to everyone for everyone.This is okay in terms of noise cancellation as it is passive cancellation and not an active one. (Active is when you can turn noise cancellation on and off. Passive means it is a tight fit that will block noise). When playing music there is hardly any noise passing through.

The marketing about...10 minutes charging, 10 hours of music...it's not a gimmick at all, works like a charm🔥• Build quality doesn't just look premium, very compact and simple yet classy at the same time 👀● Cons...• Only one negative point needs a mention... a physical on/off button. Relying only on magnetic on/off mechanism is kinda stupid. Sometime when I'm carrying it in bag...magnetic heads go detached to each other. A physical on/off button would've been a savour.Other than that the magnetic on/off works just fine.............................Bought it for 1999/- and I'm satisfied with the experience👌(Though I've seen it pricing 1799/- in very rare festive offer days)",4.0 out of 5 stars,4,Satisfied and Enjoying...living the Experience 🔥

153,Anwesha Saha,So I have been using this headphone for 11 months now. So within warranty my headphone one day out of the blue stopped turning on. So I went to customer center and they changed it. Now coming to my exchanged headphone. It had various problems 1. It was not getting fully charged within 10. 2. Sound quality was pathetic . Sound will break though it was not on full volume.So I went to customer care again . First they pinned it on me that the charger I am using was not good and just reset it and gave back. When the problem continued I went back again. This time they again replaced it ..but it has the same problem as the second one. And to that the customer care executive said it takes 15 minute to fully charge this though it is mentioned in the box 10 minute.I am pretty exhausted and will not be replacing it again as it is not going to resolve this issue. OnePlus has become really bad brand which doesn't perform quality check on it's product. Cause it cannot be a simple coincidence that I got the same issue second time. Will suggest go for boat or JBL. Cause belive me this brand is not worth it. They are just using cheap product parts and presenting it as a high end product. Maybe few years ago it was a good brand.but right now it's nothing of what it stands for. Will not be buying anything from this brand anymore for sure.,2.0 out of 5 stars,2,Worst of worst
154,Sagar Mistry ,"Returned the received unit because of issue I will mention in the review ahead. Basic points for the earphones:Sound Quality : Sound quality of the earphones nis good, but not worthy of the price. There is mind blasting available, and I did love that, but that is not the only thing I would look for in a pair of earphones. Surely the USP of the earphones isn't the sound quality but still when my old Leaf Ear have better sound quality and soundstage when compared to this, it says a lot about the OnePlus Bullets Z.Battery life: Top notch. If this is a preference, then this is the absolute best I believe out there. Came fully charged out of the box, and I used it extensively for the next 4 days before being charged again.Call quality : The limited calls that I took with it, were fine, no complaints on the other side.Connectivity : The earphones used to get disconnected at random, and also the connection feature by simple joining and separating the earbuds was lackluster at best. This was the reason of returning the earphones as I didn't know if that was the issue with my unit or the earphones in general. itself",3.0 out of 5 stars,3,Battery 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 Bass 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻Sound

But it offers a good passive noise isolation specially if you are watching a movie and it will effectively block the outside noise.OnePlus claims that a 10-minute charge is enough to give you 10 hours of music playback...Well it is a bit controversial but I would say still it manage to give satisfactory level which u will not regret.Overall it is a nice entry level bluetooth earphone which is reliable on decent sound quality with exceptional battery life helpful to use day to day usage.",4.0 out of 5 stars,4,Nice Earphones with Exceptional Battery Life

The issue is with these earphones only.Sometimes even it will disconnect in between using any app especially while playing games.Third thing, their is no quickswitch provided in this bass edition earphones.When I bought it for the first time I faced all above mentioned issues, so I thought it's a defective piece and I have returned it.Even in replaced earphones also I faced same issue so I think its a problem with this item only.

169,Jay,"If i could wrap the product review in 3 words then it would be ""Does the job"", if i had 2 words then it would be ""Not impressive"".Oneplus has built its brand on 'design' and 'value for money', however this product, as i see it , is an outlier.The first thing that oneplus prides itself in is a good design for the product, however this product is a plain built product nothing impressive about it, the sound is okayish and the bass is not that impressive considering that you are shelling out 2000 bucks for it. The most disappointing piece is the quick switch feature which is quite confidently marketed on oneplus website and amazon as present on this device but sadly is not, just a marketing gimmick, they tried to get away by saying ""Quick Switch feature on Bass Edition behaves differently. Instead of a physical function button, users will be able to switch between 3 paired devices instantly by selecting Bass Edition among Bluetooth settings on said paired devices."" but the fact of the matter is that 'a physical hardware button for switching between devices is the feature' and not going into a phone and clicking on connect, this is as weird as saying that if tomorrow oneplus removes their signature physical harware oneplus button (the one used to toggle between ring/vibrate/silent) from oneplus phones and says that the feature is there and the user put their phone is vibrate/silent/ring on the android/ios interface.Other than that the firmware design also takes a hit, sometime when you keep you earbuds magnetised to each other they dont shut down eating away your battery (another USP feature that oneplus messed up) and i'm not quite sure on the claim of 10min warp charge for 10hr backup.I would strongly say that oneplus wireless z bass edition is a downgrade from the non bass edition with the same cost to your pockets. Some of the other competitors are doing a much better job in delivering quality products at a lower pricepoint. To wrap up i'll say NOT IMPRESSED oneplus.",3.0 out of 5 stars,3,Not Impressed

I use it for literally everything except gaming starting from online classes through teams, meet & zoom all the way to watching ott stuff, youtube & listening to spotify podcasts & music. I have been a full on recommendor of the previous Oneplus bullets wireless z(normal ed) and been personally using them for a year almost at this point and frankly speaking for the price it's an absolute masterclass of a product. My only quirk would be that the sound quality is not the most impressive and this bass edition solves just that. Before this I had tried out the 7k worth of earphones in Sony's WF XB700s and they're great in literally every regards except for great features like in the oneplus which frankly speaking I could do away with and the lack of comfortability for my ears atleast which was so frustrating that I literally had to beg amazon technicians for a return which then got me to this and frankly speaking oneplus overdoes it with the bass edition for the price...now I'm not gonna be a full on fanboy and say that it sounds better than the Sony's cos it doesn't but what it does is deliver exactly what you would want from it for the price ie impeccable comfortability, great design, excellent features minus the quick pair button which sucks but I can do away with that and a bass that's a notch below the 7k Sony WF XB-700 with excellent mid & high tones, almost zero latency for videos no matter in what platform you're gonna be watching something on and a good enough battery life, good enough in that it's not as good as the previous bullets z(normal ed) which had excellent battery life so you know a 3hr drop from that should be good if not better than average at the price of just 2k. If my above mentioned usecases are exactly what you're gonna be using it for and the slight quirks don't bother ya, hands down go for it, you're not gonna be dissapointed :)",4.0 out of 5 stars,4,Brilliance with minor quirks

The wires are such low quality that the maximum they can last is the product warranty period of 1 year. In less than six months the wire start to tear itself. It will not even withstand a slight finger nail scratch and will tear open the outer rubber of the wire.When the product is new, hardly anyone will realise it's defect and give a good rating.

The best till date and the best will be.There is no point to complaint.If anyone opting to go for this product then go for it with eyes closed.

177,Nishitha K A,"This is the classic example how to screw up a perfectly working design.First of all, I bought this product because I was using the old bullet wireless earphones and in that model everything was so balanced. The sound output was really smooth and it was an overall awesome product be it for office, casual listening et. One more really good option was the one button toggle option between 2 paired devices.Bought the Bass edition and regretted it from the first listen itself. I am only listing the cons because this one has no pros.- The bass is really sucks. Its tweaked and its ugly to the ears. Still I continued using it thinking my ears will get used to it - IT DIDN'T.- Calls suck too. There is a crackling noise every time you attend a call and its not just on the recipients end its on the callers end too. Haven't been able to attend one office call properly.- Badly miss the toggle switch between devices button. Why would anyone remove such a wonderful feature is beyond me.So there you have it, do not I repeat DO NOT buy this product.",1.0 out of 5 stars,1,Worst product from a company like One Plus( I hope they see this)

188,Subasish Ghosh,"so i have been using this earphones for quite a while and here are my thoughts:Build and looks: unboxing experience was awsome and the build is pretty good, the right module is a bit heavier compared to the left due to the battery heft so it tends to shift towards right while on your neck, someone who has OCD like me might find it annyoing. Wires are of good thickness and everything else is fine.Features: The product description page says u get a quick switch feature which is not correct, u have to switch to another device just like any other bt headphones. rest all features are as advertised. Also i want to mention that while u attach the magnets the sound pauses but dosent play back while u open it, u have to press the middle button, which many youtubers have mentioned wrong in their reviwes. An intresting thing that i found was that while my phone was locked i could acess the google assistant from my bullets and play my playlist from spotify which works like a charm!Sound quality: This is what is the most important part, these bass edition have incredible bass, sometimes more than what should be in the song, which can muffle other frequencies, the treble is flat and high pitches fall on their faces... thing to note is i compared the sound with OneOdio dj pro over the ear headphones which has similar price tag, but trust me the sound u get on those is just out of the world. i have been so spoiled from those sound that this bullets feel like a cheap chandni speaker with boosted bass! if u ever enjoyed a premium sound signature u just cant enjoy the sound of oneplus bullets bass ed! If u want the best sounding device just grab the oneodio dj pro, period! But still this is the best bt earohones in 2k inr, next reason is why..Battery and call quality: I got mixed reviews about its battery life but omg, its insane, long battery life is a must for bt earphones and this delivers. I got 2 days of continious usage and charged it at 20 percent with an average of 15hrs of play time connected with multiple devices. It does provide 10 hrs of playtime with 10 mins charge which is just insane. But it has one issue though; the led light should get white while fully charged (45mins appx) but it doesnt , u have to open the charger and reconect to see the white indicator.Bluetooth range and calls: The range is more than sufficient no crackles or conncetion drops , if u have any those issues then replace it, the call quality was decent, env noise cancellation isnt that good tho.Also sound leaking isnt an issue as i saw someone mentioning it.Conclusion: If u just need a bluetooth earphone , going wireless is your first priority only then oneplus bullets z bass edition is a must buy , i feel the oppo enco m31 dosent fit the first choice because it has poor battery life which is a must because ur battery would degrade over time, getting the oppo dosent make sense just for better audio coz if audio is your priority just go all in and buy the OneOdio dj pro which is the same price and provides a sound signature of senheisers and akgs which are much much more expensive headphones!",4.0 out of 5 stars,4,keep your expectations in check!

Today the right earphone stopped working. I called customer care as the warranty period is for 1 year. They said for claiming warranty I need to have undamaged earphones, the invoice and the earphones packaging box. If have all these, you can make claim at OnePlus store. I have earphones and invoice but who keeps packaging box after 6/7 months? So they said I have to book repair through OnePlus Care app which is showing ""To safeguard against Covid-19, as per guidelines of authorities, this service mode is unavailable until further notice.""

197,Sudhanshu M.,Used it for the first time and was disappointed1) It has similar Sound Quality to my 599rs realme headphones2) It's a Bass Headphone but bass quality similar to or probably worse than a 500rs headphones. I have used Boat ( Wireless & Wired over the ear + in ear ) choose anything between 500-1500 & they definitely have better bass at lesser price tag.3) Loved its design and build quality pretty clean and attractive4) Its not isolating when the music is not playing I can hear the surronding or fan sound clearly or people talking which was biggest the disappointment for me. Some 500 rs headphones isolate the sound 10x better than this you can hardly hear anything with them more like a cheap ANC headphone.5) When you remove the headphones and stick their magnets to each other Music is paused  its disconnected from phone also when you put them in ears again it gets reconnect automatically which I think is very usefull feature.6) Battery life is definitely a lot better than similar headphones like boat and real me which requires charge after every 4-5 hours but this work for days without having to charge it,2.0 out of 5 stars,2,Read and decide if its worth it

I cant fiqure out how its happening. Its like the sound if the audios cables are only half plugged on old systems. Now im using for more than 2 months and i dont get that how it noise is generated... The thing is that it does not produce these noise frequently and if not, it sounds best..if you are an extremely cautious on the minute bit of sound quality  it may disappoint you..

214,Tirth Paghdal,"First I would like to inform you that this is my first review I do lots of shopping online but I'm writing this review for first time because of only one reason I'm stunned with this I mean which price it comes is really a mind blowing earphones if you are moderate bass lover then bro you can go for it without worry but if you are one of the peoples who like the heaviest bass not matter what the quality is contained. Unfortunately this is not for you although I'm heavy bass lover I'm very satisfied with this quality of bass which this earphone has.noise cancellation is great you will not get any chance to complaint.and especially if you are planning to use this with OnePlus device then this will be make a perfect choice of yours.Purchase it if you like OnePlus and you are not very heavy bass lover. This will provide you more than heavy bass but not heaviest and vocal,treble are very good as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Simply value for money in this price range.
215,Raghuveer,"Sound quality is decent for the given price range.The problems are1. There is no separate option to switch off, one  has to do it by joining earbuds and it is very irritating as keep on separating.2.

There's no light indicator change. U yourself have to check timing of for how much time u r charging it. Like i only charge it for like 20 minutes and took it off.

But its okay they aren't that loose.Review : The earphones are great with great bass and clear voice quality and the microphone also gives great sound output during phone calls... overall an excellent product for the price..go for it without a doubt...its worth every penny.Update - I returned these earphones just because i was getting these in Bold Black color on the official OnePlus site for Rs 1899.Really happy with the product.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Must Read This Before Buying.
229,selvakumar,"As promised by one plus brand, the sound quality and bass are really good in this product, I bought this product on January month, after 7 months of usage suddenly this headphone not switched on. Bluetooth also not connected with any mobiles. when I tried to charge, it shows battery full indication. Also I tried to reset the headphone as per the given steps in user manual. No use. If you expect the life of this headphone more than a year, than it is not suggestible. for 2000 rupees it worked only 7 months. Also In my case wires joined to the ear buds will started to be damaged after 5 months of usage (due to low quality connection in the joints). Other than this issue it is a good product.My suggestion is try any other brand products.

234,Sahil Sharma,"During neckband selection phase confused between BOAT rokerz 355 & one plus bullet bass edition but finally after watching lots of videos on youtube Bought this neckband on 14 april 2021 in 1999₹ till 2 month really loved the product no issues very satisfied( also recommend my other friends which i regret now) but after 2 months during calls (not while playing videos audios) distortion started coming(not always but very frequently). Downloaded one plus care app found out that home pickups services are not available due to covid. But if u buy new one they will definitely reach ur home but for home pickups they had covid as an excuse. Then searched for one plus centres nearby & got one 10km aways from my place. Cost me 200₹ to & fro in traveling because can not use public transport due to covid.I discussed the problem they asked for proof LUCKILY i had recorded the calls so they said they will send product for testing will take 2 days that means i have to spend 200₹ again & time also & still they told it may be COMPATIBLITY ISSUE & asked which phone brand i use. I replied redmi note 10. They said there may be no problem with earphone it may be COMPATIBLITY ISSUE.I said my sister using motorola and having same problem in her phone too. My friend was also came with me bought same neck band facing same problem but he didn't had recording of distortion as a proof so they dont even accept there product for testing, his day completely wasted he was using Vivo phone. Another my friend using REAL ME phone having same neckband faced same issue, these things i explained to them and also pointed out that these are 4 major brands of phone. They replied same sir COMPATIBILITY ISSUE.  I said if there was a COMPATIBLITY ISSUE why i am not finding written discription of product on amazon & why i have not faced so called COMPATIBLITY ISSUE during first 2 months. I am feeling cheated why would i bought a product which is not compatible with my phone i can't change my phone for a earphone.Then they said they got to know about the problem after complaints started coming. I replied so what's my fault in this if your product is not compatible i was not informed about this anywhere in discription, what i do with this earphone now. After that they agreed to take product for testing before this they just trying to make this a ""COMPATIBILITY ISSUE"" while accepting they repeatedly said if there were other reason of distortion other than COMPATIBILITY ISSUE they will replace neck band with the new one, if not they can't do anything.Now they took neckband for testing & told me to wait for 2 days.NOW no matter what happens product is going to cost me 2400 ₹ including traveling cost of repairs.Anyhow this caused me lots of inconvenience & this is unexpected from the brand i respected so much.Please dont get influenced by you tubers they may be doing paid promotions & None of them said about this distortion problem.Then i bought boat earphone of 1599₹ for my friends birthday gift instead of one plus.& As a result now i hate the word COMPATIBILITY ISSUE.In my friend circle out 43 are facing problems having phone brands redmi vivo real me my sisters phone motorola.4th friend bought just 30 days ago (on my recommendation which i regret now) having oppo phone & still working fine but neckband may remember its INCOMPATIBILITY with it after 2 months",1.0 out of 5 stars,1,TRUST ME if you have phone other than 1+ don't buy this.

Please understand as it is a 2k earphone, it has its ups and downs. Overall it works fine and basic.",2.0 out of 5 stars,2,Cracking sound and unstable connections.. Suddenly gets disconnected.
261,Shashank,I also have had heard the realme buds. The sound of OnePlus bud z is quite open. Punchy bass. And pleaseant to hear. And it also goes pretty loud. Overall these are above average headphones. Nothing special about it. It delivers what it says on the description.Light weight and good for workouts plus has additional water resistance.,5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Delivers what they say. Just not the bass

263,GK,"The only pros were it had very premium packaging which gave a good unboxing experience. Then the built quality was okay.The Cons are in Sound quality. I would rate it 2/10 I'm a previous oppo enco m1 user and the sound quality from that is perfect in every aspect it will just produce the pure sound that is encoded in your music no extra tweaking for bass or anything. Just clear audio every note, vocals, and instrument are perfectly produced which is perfect for an audiophile at that budget.But in this one plus wireless z it just sounds like a cheap headphone that we can buy for under rs.500.Conclusion: Don't judge a book by its cover. Here the cover is amazing but the content is just worthless.Also, The latency with PC is worst and when music is played you can hear a steady low buzzing sound. The good price will be under Rs. 1000.  I'm not a oppo fan I wouldn't buy any oppo mobiles. but if you are looking for bt headphone under 2k oppo enco m31 is best The sound quality is worth more than 2k but battery can only last 8 to 10 hrs without ldac..",1.0 out of 5 stars,1,Nota Headphone for Music playback

After 3 months of use one side of the earphones doesn't produce proper sound in comparison to the right side nd also the buttons have stopped working nd uhh can't take calls using these earphones as they produce crackling sound in the background which makes calling experience worst.Also the only thing i liked about this product is its battery life other than that nothing is gud in this product that one should invest 1999 in these earphones.

269,Amazon Customer,"This product is trash for me (my personal experience). Why you ask. I will tell you in 2 points.For a earphone the two main pointer are comfort and sound quality.1) Comfort-  this earphone design is extremely uncomfortable for me and I am dam sure it will be uncomfortable for most of the people. Because of the extended plastic design near the sillicon tips and having a large case housings of driver , it becomes very painfull and irritating for ears even if you wears it for half an hour. ( Very very annoying and painfull).It feels like these earphones are digging into my ears after wearing it for 1 hour.2) sound quality.- Sound quality is also not good (bellow avaerage ). This actually delivers what it said ,bass, but it way too bassy and not a good kind of bass rather a very muddy kind of bass which becomes very irritating to hear. I am currently using it with OnePlus Nord and I have tried to lower the bass through equaliser. After that  also I saw very minimal difference in bass levels. Due to the high muddy bad kind of bass other frequency (mid tones and high tones )gets  seriously affected and gets suppressed a lot due to which music listening and video watching experience gets negatively affected by a lot.I want to go back to wired earphones like sony and Sennheiser which gives a rich experience , but sadly because my phone doesn't have headphone jack I have to stick to these earphones for now😠.* Why I brought this earphone at first place ?. Because I fell for the marketing gimmic of low latency of these earphone with fnatic mode which works with OnePlus device . (In real life you will not see much a difference)I should have gone with oppo enco m31. Seen some really good reviews about oppo in technolob ,geeky Ranjit and gizzmodict yt channel",1.0 out of 5 stars,1,Read once before buying this. From a genuine indian customer
270,Lokeshwar,Not expect to much from this its just ok product the bass is ok not that great the sound quality is good but not up to mark the mic quality is good when making call but really bad when we send voice message in WhatsApp or telegram ect there is lot of noise you have to speak much louder the biuld is good the charging seed is good but is not showing the white light every time the battery backup is not what they claim its give u around 12 to 13 hrs its not for gaming so overall is just a ok product not expect to much from this.......,3.0 out of 5 stars,3,OnePlus bullet tis just ok quality

Sometimes it's sounds become mute while Bluetooth is still connected this is worse problem and quick switch is not available in this earphone you have to do it manually this worsen man.

283,Navnath (Navya),"Ive been using this product for the last 3 days.This might be too early to write an elaborate reviewbut I've known enough about this neckband to be""eligible"".1. Sound Quality:The drivers definitely produce a very balanced soundthat is surely going to satisfy most of the peopleincluding me. Whether it's about mid frequencies,vocals or the high frequency trebles, or even thelower frequencies, this neckband deals all of thosewith superior performance. Undoubtedly.2. Bass:Bass is good. But not thumping which you'll getfrom Realme's 13.6mm drivers (Buds Wireless Pro)or even 11.2mm (Buds Wireless). Those do havebetter bass but these 9.2mm re-eng ineered bassboosted drivers of Z Bass edition do produce lowerfrequencies pretty decently. You get my point. It willnot shake the inside of your ears. But you know what,whatever it produces you're surely going to love it. Ofcourse most people won't sacrifice such a decentlybalanced sound for only bass. Again it's a personalpreference. If you're one of them who listensMOSTLY BASS AND HARDLY ANYTHING ELSE, thengo for Realme.3. Battery backup:Oh my word! Jaw dropping backup which I haventimagined even in my dreams. You're easily going toget 15-17 hours of total playtime at 70-80% volume.Oneplus has done an excellent job in this field.4. Charging timeCharged the neckband from 0% to 80% in 10minutes from a powerbank which l used for testing.And it took 57 minutes to charge from 0 to 100%.The powerbank doesnt support tast charging andyou won't ever need a fast-charging supportingcharger for this neckband. For those tech savvypeople out there, the red cable that OnePlus hasprovided supports a maximum of 1 Amp currentsuppose. tried charging my Poco X2 with that cableand measured the current with Ampere app. Thehighest measurement was 850 mA. You can havean idea that 1 Amp might be the limit. So you wontneed a fast charger for that statement to be true ""10minutes of warp charge for 10 hours playtime.lamactually overwhelmed with this feature.5. Call quality:lt's decent. Theres NO noise cancellation for sure.IT you re among a heavy traic, other person wIlhear both you and the traftic. In quite environmentst works fine. Voice clarity Is really exceptiona.But even one car horn or one dog-bark from theroad beside your home can ruin the statementenvironmental noise cancellation"". For office usageswith fans and ACs arOund you, it will work flawlessly.For even better mic quality and pretty decent noisecancellation you can go with Oppo Enco m31.6. Build qualitygave me an impression that you can wear it atnight while listening to music and sleep. A bit bulkycabinet might be a problem for you it your pillowis like a stone. Otherwise it's fine. The wire is alsotextured and feels like it can handle folds andstretches. Body is polycarbonate but good qualitymaterial nonetheless. Yeah oneplus also did a goodob keeping the build quality decent enough.7. Buttons and features:Umm. Quick switch didn't work for me to be honest.When I paired it with two devices, pressing themiddle button for 5 seconds do disconnect itfrom the current device and you need to press the""oneplus bullets wireless z"" in the other device tomake a connection. lt's okay in a way but I expectedpressing for 5 seconds would instantly connect withthe previous device. Other functions are totally okay.Volume up down, changing songs, voice assistant,magnetic on off works like a charm.8. IP Rating:This might not be a big deal for most. But oneplushas this IP55 certification. Rated 5 for dust proofingability and 5 for water resistance, and hence 55.Whereas enco m31 had IPX5, which says there'sno certification for dust resistivity. These might be""theoretical"" but at the end of the day these do makea difference when comes to longevity.My opinion:This might be the best neckband under 2000. Encom31 does provide a hard competition against it withbetter sound quality and mic quality. But you actuallyneed battery backup no matter what. 6 hours inLDAC doesn't seem better enough than 17 hoursAAC. And you might not get those LDAC songs in theinternet that easily. For ordinary day-to-day purpose,AAC would be more than enough. And no one couldever say that Z Bass Edition Neckbands have not sosatisfactory sound quality. Yeah bass is not thumpybut it's there when you need it. After a debatemonths between Z Bass Edition and M31, l've finallyinclined for Z. And my regret? No there's none. I am100% satisfied with what this provides.",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,5 * great  product

287,Himanshu Juneja,Worst oneplus product I have ever used. It only works good with oneplus phones while there is a constant distortion if I use it with any other phone. It gets disconnected itself and sometimes they don't work even if they are connected to my device. I got it replaced and the replaced product has the same issues. Not going to buy an unworthy oneplus phone of atleast 40k to make earphones worth 2k work properly. Also you will start feeling pain in your ears due to the shape.

293,Shrenik,"I have been using this earphone for about 20 days and I am pretty impressed with it.As a casual user, I was looking for a neckband which ticked all the boxes right and after some research, I choose OnePlus from the likes of Realme buds and Oppo M31.Battery: I rate it highly in regards to the battery, it has quick charge and a pretty decent battry life.Type-C charging cable was a must for me.It took around 30-40 min for charging from 0-100. And the battery lasted for about 16-17 hrs at 70% vol. Level. I was using AAC Codec.Best part is it switches on/off by connecting the earbud together. Magic of the magnets. Magnets are pretty strong, they hold the earpieces strongly.Audio: For getting the best audio output choose the AAC Codec from the bluetooth settings or the developer option.I found the audio signature to be well balanced. The volume and loudness were more than enough for my liking.I could definitely feel the bass, which was nice and not overpowering. The highs and the lows are also well maintained. It was definitely enjoyable while listening to music like instrumental and also for watching movies or videos on youtube, vocals were crisp and clear. In this price range I can't complaint much in this regard. Ofc they could have given a better audio codec support like Aptx HD, but I definitely don't mind, and if you are an Apple user you wouldn't either. I tested it both on Iphone SE and Redmi Note 10. I guess for even better audio quality if you are an audiophile looking for an neckband in this price range go for Oppo enco M31.Comfort: I would consider this as personal preference. But in my opinion, this was very comfortable and lightweight, the neckbands is of permium quality sillicon, very flexible and it rest on the neck without giving me any irritation.Earpiece were also comfortable to were for long periods of time, it is good quality plastic with nice finish.The earpiece wire is kinda thick with texture, I gives me some confidence that it won't break easliy. Wires weren't too long either. I was using the medium size buds and it was soft and gave a very good isolation, preventing the outside noise to a degree.I wouldn't recommend using it while on the bed or resting your ear on pillow, it was not comfortable as it was kinda jutting outside of my ear due to the design.IPX5 Rating is also reassuring while working out, jogging, or doing physical exercise.Earpiece did stay in the ears while doing exercises. Tried to head bang to make it fall out. It stayed in. Nice job, even without extra wings for support.Call quality: I don't take much calls on this earphones, but ones I did take was okey, I was audible enough at the other end, the surrounding noise was also creeping in while having a conversation. I would give an average rating if you ask me. It gets the job done.Summery: Definitely a great choice of wireless bluetooth neckband at this price range, I would definitely recommend it at a price of Rs. 1500-1700.My only concern is about the longevity of this product, I'll try to update my review in 6 months or in between if something happens.

376,Utsab Roy,"I have been using the one plus bullets wireless z for almost 3 months now.I would like to point out few points:Sound quality: Sound quality is really really good. I had lots of faith on One Plus and they did an amazing job in thatNoise Cancellation: There is enough noice cancellation, to block off all chitter chatter around you while you are listening to music. Very loud noises can still be heard. Don't expect special noise cancellation at this price point, but its decent enough on these earphones.Bass Quality: Bass is really a very main point for choosing our headphones and earphones nowadays. Even though while I was having a dilemma reading the rest of the reviews, that the one plus bullets wireless z lacks in bass, I would like to go ahead and say confidently that, it's bass is just perfect, and you will love it. It's thump has been optimised so that you can hear for longer time. But I am pretty sure there are equalizers available in almost all smartphones and music apps, and with a slight twitch you will be able to get back the thump you want. When connected with laptops, the bass is just perfect. Don't worry about it just go for it.Mic Quality: I am just amazed at the microphone quality of the earphones, they are just awesome. From the moment I have started wearing these earphones I always prefer receiving calls over these only. Sound is just clear.Water resistant: Yes, it is sweat and dust resistant and I use it daily for sprinting (and workout), and I out of all people, sweat very much, and I have not yet seen any problems in the earphones because of coming in contact with my sweat.Overall: It is just an amazing product, you will love it, just go for it",5.0 out of 5 stars,5,Long term review (After 3 months)
